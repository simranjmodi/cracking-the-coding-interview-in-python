4.11 Random Node

You are implementing a binary search tree class from scratch, which, in addition to
insert, find, and delete, has a method get_random_node() which returns a random node
from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen. Design and implement
an algorithm for get_random_node(), and explain how you would implement the rest of
the methods.
